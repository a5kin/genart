## Generative Study: Arcs Of Verona

For several years I was watching my wife drawing sketches and studies to grow as an artist.
Then suddenly I had the idea to try the same by myself. But using the power of pure code instead of brushes and pencils.

So, I called this format "Generative Studies", wrote a brief Concept for myself, and started with my first study.

The original photo I tried to reproduce was an arcade somewhere in the city of Verona.
Its beautiful colors and magnificent architecture was an inspiration for me during the whole process.
